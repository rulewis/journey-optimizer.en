>The main steps to create offers and use them in a decision are presented in [this section](../offer-library/key-steps.md).

When you are more familiar with [!DNL Offer Decisioning] and you have already created at least one offer decision, the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** tab displays your most recent offers, collections and decisions.

Click an offer or a decision to directly access the selected item's details.

Click the **[!UICONTROL View all]** button to access the offer, collection, or decision lists.

## Search and filter information

Use the **search bar** to find a specific item.

**Filters** can also be accessed by clicking the filter icon on the top left of the list. They allows you to filter the displayed elements according to different criteria. You can, for example, filter the placements that have been created for the email communication channel and image-type contents.
