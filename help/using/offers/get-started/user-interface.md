# User Interface {#user-interface}

The Offer Library allows you to create and manage your placements and offers in one single place, as well as access all the created decisions (previously known as offer activities).

Use the  **[!UICONTROL Offers]** menu to manage personalized and fallback offers, organize them into collections, and deliver them by creating decisions:

* **[!UICONTROL Offers]**: Access your personalized and fallback offers or create new ones. See [Creating an offer](../offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.md) and [Creating a fallback offer](../offer-library/creating-fallback-offers.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Collections]**: Create and manage static and dynamic offer collections. See [About offer collections](../offer-library/creating-collections.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Decisions]**: Create and manage decisions to deliver your offers. See [Create decisions](../offer-activities/create-offer-activities.md).

Use the  **[!UICONTROL Components]** menu to manage the components required to create offers:

* **[!UICONTROL Placements]**: Create and manage placements where your offers will display. See [Creating placements](../offer-library/creating-placements.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Tags]**: Create and manage tags to organize and filter your offers. See [Creating tags](../offer-library/creating-tags.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Rules]**: Manage the conditions under which your offers are presented. See [Creating a decision rule](../offer-library/creating-decision-rules.md).

* **[!UICONTROL Rankings]**: Create and manage ranking formulas to determine which offer should be presented first for a given placement. See [Create ranking formulas](../offer-library/create-ranking-formulas.md).

## Search and filter information

Use the **search bar** to find a specific item.

**Filters** can also be accessed by clicking the filter icon on the top left of the list. They allows you to filter the displayed elements according to different criteria. You can, for example, filter the placements that have been created for the email communication channel and image-type contents.

## Customize displayed information

Lists from Decision Management menus can be personalized using the configuration button on the top right of the lists.

This allows you to choose the information to display according to your needs.

Note that columns customization is saved for each user.

The offers and decisions lists also allow you to perform bulk actions on several elements. To do this, select the desired offers or decisions, then select the action you want to perform from the information pane.

Note that you can also duplicate an existing offer or decisions in order to create a copy with the **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status. This can be performed either from the information pane or from an offer or a decision's detailed view.

## Offers and decisions change logs {#changes-logs}

The Offer Library allows you to vizualise all the changes that have been made to an offer or a decision. To do this, open the offer or decision by clicking on its name in the list, then select the **[!UICONTROL Change log]** tab.

All the changes that have been made display in this screen, as well as the name of the user that performed the changes.
