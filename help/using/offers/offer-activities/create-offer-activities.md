# Create decisions {#create-offer-activities}

Decisions (previously known as offer activities) are containers for your offers that will leverage the Offer Decision Engine in order to pick the best offer to deliver, depending on the target of the delivery.

➡️ [Discover this feature in video](#video)

The list of decisions is accessible in the **[!UICONTROL Offers]** menu / **[!UICONTROL Decisions]** tab. Filters are available to help you retrieve decisions according to their status or start and end dates.

Before creating a decision, make sure that the components below have been created in the Offer Library:

* [Placements](../offer-library/creating-placements.md)
* [Collections](../offer-library/creating-collections.md)
* [Personalized offers](../offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.md)
* [Fallback offers](../offer-library/creating-fallback-offers.md)

## Create the decision {#create-activity}

1. Access the decisions list, then click **[!UICONTROL Create activity]**.

1. Specify the decision's name as well as its start and end date and time, then click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

1. By default, if multiple offers are eligible for this placement, the offers with the highest priority score will be delivered to the customer.

    If you want to use a specific formula to choose which eligible offer to deliver, select a ranking formula from the **[!UICONTROL Rank offers by]** drop-down list. For more on this, refer to [this section](../offer-activities/configure-offer-selection.md).

1. The **[!UICONTROL Constraint]** field restricts the selection of offers for this placement. This constraint can be applied by using a decision rule or one or several Adobe Experience Platform segments.

    To restrict the selection of the offers to the members of an Adobe Experience Platform segments, select **[!UICONTROL Segments]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Add segments]**.

    ![](../../assets/activity_constraint_segment.png)
    
    Add one or several segments from the left pane, combine them using the **[!UICONTROL And]** / **[!UICONTROL Or]** logical operators, then click **[!UICONTROL Select]** to confirm.

    For more on how to work with segments, refer to the [Segmentation Service documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/segmentation/home.html).

    If you want to add a selection constraint for this placement using a decision rule, select the **[!UICONTROL Decision rule]** option, then drag the desired rule from the left pane into the **[!UICONTROL Decision rule]** area. For more on how to create a decision rule, refer to [this section](../offer-library/creating-decision-rules.md).

## Add a fallback offer {#add-fallback}

Select the fallback offer that will be presented as a last resort to the customers that do not match the offers eligibility rules and constraints, then click **[!UICONTROL Next]**.

## Review and save the decision {#review}

If everything is configured properly and your decision is ready to be used to  present offers to customers, click **[!UICONTROL Finish]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Save and activate]**.

You can also save the decision as draft, in order to edit and activate it later on.

![](../../assets/save-activities.png)

The decision displays in the list with the **[!UICONTROL Live]** or **[!UICONTROL Draft]** status, depending on whether you activated it or not in the previous step. 

It is now ready to be used to deliver offers to customers. You can select it to display its properties and edit or suppress it.

For more on to deliver offers, refer to these sections:

* [Add personalized offers in messages](../../deliver-personalized-offers.md)
* [Deliver offers using APIs](../api-reference/decisions-api/deliver-offers.md)
