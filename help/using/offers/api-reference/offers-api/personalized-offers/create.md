# Create a personalized offer

A personalized offer is a customizable marketing message based on eligibility rules and constraints.

You can create a personalized offer by making a POST request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API, while providing your container ID.

## Accept and Content-Type headers

The following table shows the valid values which comprise the *Content-Type* and *Accept* fields in the request header:

| Header name | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Accept | `application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1` |
| Content-Type | `application/schema-instance+json; version=1;  schema="https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/personalized-offer;version=0.5"` |

**API format**

```http
POST /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/{CONTAINER_ID}/instances
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for repository APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/` |
| `{CONTAINER_ID}` | The container where the personalized offers are located. | `e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6/instances' \

**Response**

A successful response returns information on the newly created personalized offer, including its unique instance ID and placement `@id`. You can use the instance ID in later steps to update or delete your personalized offer.

```json
{
    "instanceId": "0f4bc230-13df-11eb-bc55-c11be7252432",
    "@id": "xcore:personalized-offer:124e181c8b0d7878",

    "repo:createdBy": "{CREATED_BY}",
    "repo:lastModifiedBy": "{MODIFIED_BY}",
    "repo:createdByClientId": "{CREATED_CLIENT_ID}",
    "repo:lastModifiedByClientId": "{MODIFIED_CLIENT_ID}"
}
```

## Limitations {#limitations}

Some offer constraints are currently not supported with the mobile [!DNL Experience Edge] workflows, for example `Capping`. The `Capping` field value specifies the number of times an offer can be presented across all users. For more details, see [Offer eligibility rules and constraints documentation](../../../offer-library/creating-personalized-offers.md).
