# Deliver offers using the Decisions API

With Decision Management, you can create and deliver end-user personalized offer experiences, across channels and applications using business logic and decision rules. An offer is a marketing message that may have rules associated with it that specify who is eligible to see the offer.

You can create and deliver offers by making a POST request to the [!DNL Decisions] API.

This tutorial requires a working understanding of APIs, specifically with regards to Decision Management. For more information, see the [Decision Management API developer guide](../getting-started.md). This tutorial also requires that you have a unique placement ID and decision ID value available. If you have not acquired these values, see the tutorials for [creating a placement](../offers-api/placements/create.md) and [creating a decision](../activities-api/activities/create.md).

| `xdm:propositionRequests.xdm:placementId` | The unique placement identifier. | `"xdm:placementId": "xcore:offer-placement:ffed0456"` |
| `xdm:propositionRequests.xdm:activityId` | The unique decision identifier. | `"xdm:activityId": "xcore:offer-activity:ffed0123"` |
| `xdm:itemCount` | The number of offers to be returned. The maximum number is 30. | `"xdm:itemCount": 2` |
| `xdm:profiles` | This object holds information about the profile for which the decision is requested. For an API request this will contain one profile. |
| `xdm:profiles.xdm:identityMap` | This object holds a set of end user identities based on the namespace integration code of the identity. The identity map can carry more than one identity of each namespace. For more information on namespaces, see the [Identity namespace overview](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-platform/identity/namespaces.html). | `Email: [{"xdm:id": "123@abc.com"}]` |

| `xdm:allowDuplicatePropositions` | This object the control structure of the De-duplication rules. It consists of a series of flags that indicate if the same option can be proposed across a certain dimension. A flag that is set to true means duplicates are allowed and should not be removed across the category indicated by the flag. A flag set to false means that the decision engine should not make the same proposition across the dimension and instead pick the next best option for one of the sub-decisions. |
| `xdm:allowDuplicatePropositions.xdm:acrossActivities` | If set to true, multiple decisions may get assigned the same option. | `"xdm:acrossActivities": true` |
| `xdm:allowDuplicatePropositions.xdm:acrossPlacements` | If set to true, multiple placements may get assigned the same option. | `"xdm:acrossPlacements": true` |
| `xdm:mergePolicy.xdm:id` | Identifies the merge policy by which to govern the data returned by profile access service.

| `xdm:responseFormat` | A set of flags that formats the response content. |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:includeContent` | A boolean value that, if set to `true`, includes content to the response. | `"xdm:includeContent": true` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:includeMetadata` | An object that is used to specify what additional metadata is returned. If this property is not included, then `xdm:id` and `repo:etag` are returned by default. | `name` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:activity` | This flag identifies the specific metadata information returned for `xdm:activity`. | `name` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:option` | This flag identifies the specific metadata information returned for `xdm:option`. | `name`, `characteristics` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:placement` | This flag identifies the specific metadata information returned for `xdm:placement`. | `name`, `channel`, `componentType` |

| `xdm:propositions.xdm:content` | The format of the response content. | Response content can be: `text`, `html block`, or `image link` |

The format may be used to determine the software, hardware or other equipment needed to display or operate the resource. It is recommended to select a value from a controlled vocabulary, for example, the list of [Internet Media Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/) defining computer media formats. | `"dc:format": "image/png"` or `"image/jpeg"`|
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:fallback.xdm:deliveryURL` | An optional URL to read the asset from a content delivery network or service endpoint.
