Here is the list of all the fields that can be used in the **[!UICONTROL Decision Object Repository - Personalized Offers]** dataset.

<!--Personalized offers form the set of choices for a decision. The objective for decisioning is to take a large inventory of items and apply numerous constraint rules to that inventory to narrow it down and then to rank the qualifying options according to a criteria. The resulting propositions assemble and personalize the experience for specific individuals.-->
    
## Identifier

#### _experience > decisioning > characteristics

**Field:** characteristics
**Title:** Decision Option Characteristics
**Description:** Additional properties or attributes belonging to this particular decision option. Different instances can have different characteristics (keys in the map). The characteristics are name value pairs used to distinguish one decision option from others. Characteristics are used as values in content that represents this decision option and as features to analyze and optimize the performance of an option. When every instance has the same attribute or property, that aspect should be modeled as an extension schema that derives from decision option detail.
**Type:** object

#### _experience > decisioning > contents

If the profile constraint does not need to consider values of each of the option, i.e. it is invariant of the options from the option selection, the profile constraint that evaluates to 'false' cancels out the entire option selection. On the other hand, a profile constraint rule that takes an option as a parameter is evaluated for each qualifiying option of the option selection.

**Title:** Order Evaluation
**Description:** Evaluation of a relative order of one or more decision options. Options with higher ordinal values are selected over any options with lower ordinal values.

    **Type:** string

**_experience > decisioning > ranking > Priority**
    
**Field:** priority
**Title:** Priority
**Description:** The priority of a single decision option relative to all other options. Options for which no order function is given are prioritized using this propery.
