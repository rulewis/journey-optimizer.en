# Journey properties attributes {#journey-properties}

In the advanced expression editor, you will find the **Journey Properties** category, below the event and data source categories. This category contains technical fields related to the journey for a given profile. This is the information retrieved by the system from live journeys, such as the journey ID or the specific errors encountered.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Journey properties attributes are also available in the simple expression editor. See this [section](../condition-activity.md#about_condition)

You will find information, for example, about:

* journey version: journey uid, journey version uid, instance uid, etc.
* errors: data fetch, action execution, etc.
* current step, last current step, etc.
* discarded profiles

You can use these fields to build expressions. During the journey execution, the values will be retrieved directly from the journey. 

Here are a few examples of use cases:

* **Log discarded profiles**: you can send all profiles excluded from a message by a capping rule to a third-party system for logging purposes. For this, you set up a path in case of timeout and error and add a condition to filter on a specific error type, for example: "discard people by capping rule". You can then push the discarded profiles to a third-party system via a custom action. 

* **Send alerts in case of errors**: you can send a notification to a third-party system every time an error occurs on a message. For this, you set up a path in case of error, add a condition and a custom action. You can send a notification on a Slack channel, for example, with the description of the error encountered.

* **Refine errors in reporting** : instead of having just one path for messages in error, you can define a condition per error type. This will allow you to refine the reporting and view all error types data.
